# Enterprise-Sales-Analysis-and-Overview
In this project I've analysed a big enterprise's sales, including trends, revenue, profit, location and products. I compared online and offline sales. 
The analysis helped me to demonstrate to sales  team on how they were performing, which products, regions and marketing campaigns drove more sales.
